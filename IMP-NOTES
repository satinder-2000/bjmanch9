JUST ONE FLOW IN APP - USER REGISTER
Tried to create second Flow CreateForum but the Flow crashes with some strange errors as if we cannot interrupt a flow once it has started. 
E.g - is from UserRegister Flow, the User decides to jump on CreateForum flow, it does not work and system generates an error. 
Solution> Made CreateForumMBean as SessionScoped
