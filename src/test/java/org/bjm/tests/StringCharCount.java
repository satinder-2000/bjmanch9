The social activist lady politician who wants the Shabana's Kotha removed so Kulbushan Kharbanda can raze to set up a shopping complex where the politician's son in law will own majority of shops, Smita Patil(Om Shanthi) being the illegitimate daughter of saeed jaffrey and hence being in love with her own half brother, Ila Arun is hilarious as being ever pregnant and the monkey scenes are also very comedic. Amrish Puri's( Om Shanthi) cameo was amazing. This movie had the entire star cast of 80's parallel cinema.";
